# TIC-TAC-TOE in Glut
Tic Tac Toe is one of the simplest games, which is also called as noughts and crosses. This game is very popular and is fairly simple by itself. It is actually a two-player game. It is a pencil and paper game for two players. 
In our game, there are 3 x 3 squares, where players select X and O, as their playing item. 
The player 1 and player 2 play with the symbolâ€™s 'X' and 'O' respectively.
The aim is to create a straight line horizontally or vertically or diagonally - on a 3 x 3 grid with two intentions: 
o	Create a straight line before the opponent to win the game.
o	Restrict the opponent from creating a straight line first.
If any player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in the following combinations then that player wins. The combinations are:							
A.	 1, 2, 3 
B.	 4, 5 6
C.	 7, 8, 9 
D.	 1, 4, 7
E.	 2, 5, 8 
F.	 3, 6, 9
G.	 1, 5, 9
H.	 3, 5, 7

In case logically no one creates a straight line, the game results in a draw.
